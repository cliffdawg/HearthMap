HearthMap is a map-based app that collects geolocation data and displays hotspots of both the user and other users around the area. It renders visual hotspots on a map where the most people have frequented, as well as where the user frequents the most. With pins to save memorable locations, HearthMap offers a fresh way to explore locally and globally.
